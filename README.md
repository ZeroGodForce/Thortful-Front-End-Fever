For reasons I can't determine, the code worked just fine until I wanted to clean it up and seperate it properly. I'm sure there's something minor in there that's wrong but I've run out of time because the late night library is kicking me out

Thanks for the consideration anyway, apart from the endless frustration with my own code, it was actually a very interesting challenge.
